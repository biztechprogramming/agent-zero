## Claude Code Review Required

I've reviewed the changes you made using git diff and found issues that need to be fixed:

{{violations}}

{{improvements}}

**You must fix these issues before we can proceed.** I will not fix the code for you - this is your responsibility as Claude Code.

Please address:
1. All violations listed above
2. Apply the suggested improvements
3. Ensure all configurable values are externalized to the database
4. Add comments documenting any design patterns used

Once you've made the fixes, I'll review again to ensure compliance with our standards.
